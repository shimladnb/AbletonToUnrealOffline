AbletonToUnrealOffline

Render audio / midi tracks to a CSV file for later use in Unreal Engine. 

USE: 
  - Drag the .amxd files onto either a midi or audio track in ableton. 
  - Just hit play and let it play. The devices will automatically record anything that's being played on the track 
  - Preview your recorded CSV file by clicking "open"
  - Write the actual file with "write", don't forget to add .csv to the file at the end when saving it to your storage
 
NOTES:

  It records everything with a build in clock, that clock runs at 30 fps. You can turn off "use heavy clock" if you want the m4l device to be less precisce but more efficiently if   you're running into CPU performance issues.
